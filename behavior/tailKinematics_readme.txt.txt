analysis of tail kinematics using methods in Dunn., 2020
main file: behavior_pipeline.mlx, calling it will run the whole pipeline
It will (1)detect bout first, and do (2)PCA on tail kinematics, (3)align bout with different length using dynamic time warping technique; 
(4)cluster bouts (5) visualization
